Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park.

I study International Relations and Comparative Politics. My research focuses on international water conflict & cooperation. I focus on the effects of environmental institutions & treaties on managing transboundary water dispute.

Before coming to the University of Maryland, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in International Affairs from Eastern Washington University.
